## What do we need to build a Scheme?

[](../img/WYAS-Lisp-Interpreter-Steps.png)

To make any programming language, we must take user inputed text, turn that text into
tokens, parse that into an abstract syntax tree, then evaluate that format into a result.  Fortunately, we can use the same structure, `LispVal`, for both the abstract syntax tree, returned by the parser, and the return result of the interpreter.  Homoiconicity for the win! The lexer and parser is contained in a single library, Parsec, which does most of the work for us.  Once we have parsed into LispVal, we have to evaluate that `LispVal` to get the result of the computation. Evaluation must be done for all the different configurations of S-Expressions, including specials forms like `begin` and `define`. During that computation we need to have an environment for keeping track of bound variable, and an IO monad for reading or writing files during execution.  We will also need a way to convert Haskell functions to internal Scheme functions, and a collection of these functions stored in the Scheme environment.  Finally, a suitable user interface, including Read/Evaluate/Print/Loop, way to run read files/run programs, and standard library of functions loaded at runtime defined in Scheme is needed.

This may seem like a lot.  But don't worry, all these things, and more, are already available in this project.  Together, we'll go through line by line and make sense out of how these Haskell abstraction coalesce to implement a Scheme!


## Project Road Map: What do we have?

[](../img/WYAS-Dependency-Tree.png)

* **Main.hs**  Handles the creation of the binary executable, parsing of command line options.
* **Repl.hs**    Read Evaluate Print Loop code.
* **Parser.hs**    Lexer and Parser using Parsec code. Responsibility for the creation of LispVal object from Text input.  .
* **Eval.hs**    Contains the evaluation function, `eval`. Patten matches on all configurations of S-Expressions and computes the resultant `LispVal`.
* **LispVal.hs**    defines LispVal, evaluation monad, LispException, and report printing functions.
* **Prims.hs**    Creates the primitive environment functions, which themselves are contained in a map.  These primitive functions are Haskell functions mapped to `LispVal`s.
* **Pretty.hs**    Pretty Printer, used for formatting error messages. Might drop this, what do you think?


## An Engineering Preface
Before we start, there is a note I have to make on efficient memory usage Haskell.  The default data structure for Haskell strings, `String`, is quite wasteful in its memory [usage](http://blog.johantibell.com/2011/06/memory-footprints-of-some-common-data.html).  There is an alternative, [Data.Text](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-1.2.2.1/docs/Data-Text.html), but to get Haskell to parse strings into `Text` instead of `String` we must use:
```Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Data.Text as T
```
This declaration will be at the top of every file in the project. Not every library in the Haskell code base has converted to `Text`, so there are two essential helper functions:
```Haskell
T.pack :: String -> Text
T.unpack :: Text -> String
```
However, this project is able to use overloaded strings in all of the files.  I strongly suggest you do the same in a production environment, and I advocate Text becoming the standard for the language.  This is the "strong" position on Text, and requires that all upstream libraries be written to either Text agnostic, or work with Text. This may not always be the case. For these situations, you can convert into Text using `T.pack`, or just keep using `String`.


## Internal representation, welcome to LispVal
We need a way to represent the structure of a program that can be manipulated within Haskell.  Haskell's type system that allows for pattern matching on data constructors, which will allow our `eval` function to differentiate different forms of S-Expressions.


## LispVal Definition
After much ado, here's the representation of the S-Expression. All code and data will be represented by one of the following data constructors.  There is nothing else, let's take a look!
```Haskell
data LispVal
  = Atom T.Text
  | List [LispVal]
  | Number Integer
  | String T.Text
  | Fun IFunc
  | Lambda IFunc EnvCtx
  | Nil
  | Bool Bool deriving (Typeable)

data IFunc = IFunc { fn :: [LispVal] -> Eval LispVal }
```
`Bool`, `Number` and  `String` are straight forward warpers for Haskell values.  `Nil` is the null type, and the result of evaluating an empty list.  `Atom` represents variables, and when evaluated with return some other value from the environment.  To represent an S-Expression we will use `List`, with 0 or more `LispVal`.
Now for the tricker part, functions.  There are two basic types of functions we will encounter in Scheme.  Primitive functions like `+` use `Fun`.  The second type of function is generated in an expression like:
```Haskell
((lambda (x) (+ x 100)) 42)
```
To handle lexical scoping, the lambda function must enclose the environment present at the time the function is created.  Conceptually, the easiest way is to just bring the environment along with the function.  For an implemention, the data constructor `Fun` accepts  `EnvCtx`, which is lexical environment, as well as `IFunc`, which is its a Haskell function.  You'll notice it takes its arguments as a list of `LispVal`, then returns an object of type `Eval LispVal`.  For more on `Eval`, read the next section.  There's also a `deriving (Typeable)`, which is needed for error handling, more on that later!


## Evaluation Monad
```Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}

import qualified Data.Map as Map

import Control.Monad.Except
import Control.Monad.Reader

type EnvCtx = Map.Map T.Text LispVal

newtype Eval a = Eval { unEval :: ReaderT EnvCtx (ResourceT IO) a }
  deriving (Monad
           , Functor
           , Applicative
           , MonadReader EnvCtx
           , MonadIO)

```

For evaluation, we need to handle the context of a couple of things: the environment of variable/value bindings, exception handling, and IO.  In Haskell, IO and exception handling are already done with monads.  Using [monad transformers](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#mtl-transformers) we can incorporate IO, and Reader (to handle lexical scope) together in a single monad.  Using `deriving`, the functions available to each of the constituent monads will be available to the transformed monad without having to define them using `lift`.  A great guide about using monad transformers to implement interpreters is [Monad Transformer Step by Step](../sources/Transformers.pdf).  It will start with simple a simple example and increase complexity.  For our scheme its important to remember that evaluation is done for `LispVal` that are wrapped within the `Eval` monad, which will provide the context of evaluation.  The process of `LispVal -> Eval LispVal` is handled by the `eval` function, and this will be discussed a few chapter ahead.

#### Reader Monad and Lexical Scope

We will be using the `ReaderT` monad to handle lexical scope.  Reader is basically a function `e -> a`, which in our case is `EnvCtx -> Eval LispVal`.  If you are not familiar with monads, or `ReaderT`, [you can see the definitions here](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#reader-monad). I'll try to explain how we are using. `ReaderT` has to basic functions: `ask` and `local`.  Within the monadic context, `ask` is a function which gets `EnvCtx`, and `local` is a function which sets `EnvCtx` and evaluates an expression.  As you can imagine, we will be using `ask` a lot to get the `EnvCtx`, then using `Map` functions to either get or add variables, then using `local` with a modified `EnvCtx` and evaluating the next function.  If this doesn't make sense yet, that's okay.  There is example code on the way!


## Show LispVal
While on the topic of `LispVal`, we will need a way to print them out.  Ideally, we will have a functions for both `LispVal -> T.Text` and `T.Text -> LispVal`.  The latter will be covered in the next section on parsing.

```Haskell
instance Show LispVal where
  show = T.unpack . showVal

showVal :: LispVal -> T.Text
showVal val =
  case val of
    (Atom atom)      -> atom
    (String str)    -> T.concat [ "\"" ,str,"\""]
    (Number num)    -> T.pack $ show num
    (Bool True)     -> "#t"
    (Bool False)    -> "#f"
    Nil             -> "Nil"
    (List contents) -> T.concat ["(", T.unwords $  showVal <$>  contents, ")"]
    (Fun _ )        -> "(internal function)"
    (Lambda _ _)    -> "(lambda function)"
```
As you can see, we are using `case` to match data constructors instead of pattern matching the arguments of `showVal`.  We have no good way to represent functions as `Text`, otherwise, `LispVal` and `Text` should be interconvertible.  This is the case before evaluation, or as long as the S-Expression does not contain functions from either data constructor.  This feature is analogous to serialization, and later, when we have parsing, we will have de-serialization.

#### [Understanding Check]
What's the difference between `Text` and `String`?
How do we represent  S-Expressions in Haskell?
What is a monad transformer? How is this abstraction used to evaluate S-Expressions?
Can you think of some alternative ways to represent S-Expressions? What about [GADT](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/6.6/docs/html/users_guide/gadt.html)? If you would like to see a Haskell language project using GADTs, [GLambda](https://github.com/goldfirere/glambda) is a great project!
